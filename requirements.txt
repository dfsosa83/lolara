# Forex Volatility Modeling
This project focuses on modeling forex volatility using a variety of techniques. It explores feature selection methods utilizing voting and trains three different models, followed by a super learner algorithm to generate a final outcome.

# Overview
The aim of this project is to develop a robust model for forecasting forex volatility. Volatility in foreign exchange markets is a key factor affecting trading decisions, risk management, and hedging strategies. By accurately predicting volatility, traders and financial institutions can make better-informed decisions.

# Features
Feature selection: The project employs a voting-based feature selection method to identify the most relevant predictors for forex volatility modeling.

# Model training: 
Three different models are used to capture the complex relationship between predictors and forex volatility. These models are carefully designed and trained using historical data.

# Super learner algorithm: 
The project introduces a super learner algorithm, which combines the predictions from multiple models to improve the overall accuracy and robustness of the volatility forecast.
